# üß¨ Melanoma Detection Using Deep Learning

This project applies deep learning to detect melanoma from dermoscopic skin lesion images. Melanoma is a serious type of skin cancer, and early detection is critical. The system uses image classification techniques to predict whether a skin lesion is benign or malignant.

## üì∑ Dataset
- **ISIC (International Skin Imaging Collaboration)** dataset
- Includes thousands of labeled dermoscopic images for various skin conditions

## üß† Model
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**
- Preprocessing includes resizing, normalization, and augmentation
- Binary classification: Melanoma vs Non-Melanoma

## üîß Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- Jupyter Notebook

## üöÄ How to Use
1. Preprocess images and feed them into the model
2. Train or load the pretrained CNN
3. Input a new image to get melanoma prediction (Benign or Malignant)

## üéØ Goal
- Assist medical professionals in early skin cancer detection
- Reduce manual diagnosis errors through AI
